1.	MEDIUM
	file: 6-title-case.js
	issue 1: index 0 is doubled in final output
	issue 2: nothing is getting capitalized
	guess: line 43 maybe. the path turns the wrong way somewhere

2. 	MEDIUM
	file: 7-longest-vowel-chain.js
	issue 1: command to see which element of an array is longest?
	issue 2: is my logic even going the right direction?  What should I do next?
	guess: there's a totally better path to take here

CURRENT: 	NOT AS EASY AS I EXPECTED
	file: 7-zero-balanced-array.js
	issue: failed 3 cases, all false when expected true.  I can't identify the pattern
	guess: none

4.	POSSIBLY EASY
	file: 7-big-fibonacci.js
	issue: stops calculating correctly when n gets really big
	guess: possibly the e+ rounding, but one error doesn't use e+ (correct answers never do)

5. 	EASY
	file: 8-polish-alphabet.js
	issue: isn't processing the array at all (map is returning input without changing it)
	guess: I miswrote the map function or the if statement
